# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and versions match the minimum IPA version required to use functionality.


## [v7.2.2] - 2025-10-14

### Added

- Parse table spans from ETL Output as `Table.spans`.
- `NULL_CELL`, `NULL_RANGE`, `NULL_TABLE`, and `NULL_TOKEN` constants.
- Document Extraction attributes for assigning tokens, tables, and cells from OCR:
    - `DocumentExtraction.tokens`, `DocumentExtraction.tables`, `DocumentExtraction.cells`
- Document Extraction convenience properties for singular token, table, and cell access:
    - `DocumentExtraction.token`, `DocumentExtraction.table`, `DocumentExtraction.cell`
- `PredictionList.assign_ocr(etl_outputs, tokens=True, tables=True)` method.
- Custom `__hash__` methods for tables and cells to speed up `.groupby(...)`.
- Prediction `.copy()` methods that only copy mutable state.

### Changed

- Move `Box` and `Span` from results to etloutput to avoid circular imports.
  (Both can still be imported from either module.)
- Return `NULL_TOKEN` instead of raising an exception from `EtlOutput.token_for(span)`.
- Rewrite table cell lookup `EtlOutput.table_cells_for(span)` using a fast, span-based,
  binary search algorithm that can return multiple overlapped table cells.

### Removed

- Custom `results` and `etloutput` error classes that are nearly never used.
  (Replaced with idiomatic Python error classes.)


## [v7.2.1] - 2025-09-09

### Fixed

- Account for row spans and column spans in ETL output tables.
  Affects `Table.from_dict()`, `Range.from_dict()`, and `EtlOutput.table_cell_for()`.
- Narrow `AutoReviewed.changes` type to v3 result file changes,
  as that's the only version supported by `results` and `polling` modules.


## [v7.2.0] - 2025-06-17

### Added

- Unified support for `dict`, JSON `str`, and JSON `bytes` as loadable types in
  `results.load()`, `results.load_async()`, `etloutput.load()`, and
  `etloutput.load_async()`.

### Changed

- Rename `model`, `ModelGroup`, and `ModelGroupType` to `task`, `Task`, and `TaskType`
  in the `results` module.
- Table OCR is automatically loaded when present
  (`AutoReviewPoller(..., load_tables=True)` and `etloutput.load(..., tables=True)` are
  now the default).

### Removed

- v1 result file support and code paths in the `results` module.
- v1 ETL output support and code paths in the `etloutput` module.
- IPA 6.X support and edge cases in the `results` and `etloutput` modules.


## [v6.14.2] - 2025-05-08

### Added

- Support for imported models using IPA 7.2 `component_metadata` section.
- Parse and preserve full span information for `Unbundling` predictions.
- `group = next(group)` idiom.

### Removed

### Fixed

- Mypy configuration.


## [v6.14.1] - 2025-03-20

### Added

- `results` module.
- `etloutput` module.
- Async coroutine support in the `retry` decorator.

### Changed

  copying workflows.

### Changed

- Refactor `AutoReview` to simplify setup.

  model training simple. This class also includes a "copy_teach_task" method that is a
  frequently needed standalone method.
- Simplify `StaggeredLoop` implementation to inject labeled samples into a development
  workflow (deprecated previous version).


## v2.0.2 - 2022-08-31

### Added

- Support for staggered looped learning.
- Ground truth compare feature to compare a snapshot against model predictions and
  receive analytics.

- Update `Snapshot` class to account for updated target spans.
- Update Add Model calls to align with 5.1.4 components.


## v2.0.1 - 2022-05-20

### Added

- Feature in `FileProcessing` class to read and return file as JSON.
- Feature in `Highlighter` class to redact and replace highlights with spoofed data.
- `Download` class to support downloading resources from an Indico Cluster.

### Changed

- Upgrade client to 5.1.3.
- Update SDK calls for Indico 5.x compatibility.

### Removed

- `FindRelated` class in `indico_wrapper`.


## v1.2.2 - 2022-03-03

### Added

- Feature in `Positioning` class to calculate overlap between two bounding boxes on the
  same page.

### Changed

- Update metrics plot to order ascending based on latest model.

### Fixed

- Optional dependencies to support M1 installation.


## v1.2.0 - 2022-01-06

### Added

- Distance measurements in the prediction `Positioning` class.
- Features on the `Extractions` class:
  - predictions that are removed by any method are saved in an attribute if they're
    needed for logs, etc.; get all text values for a particular label,
  - get most common text value for a particular label.
- Better exception handling for workflow submissions and more flexibility on format of
  what is returned (allows custom response JSON to avoid the `WorkflowResult` class).


## v1.1.2 - 2021-12-06

### Added

- Update functionality for large dataset creation.
- Batch options allow for more reliable dataset uploads.


## v1.1.1 - 2021-12-06
